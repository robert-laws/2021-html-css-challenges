# 2021 - HTML & CSS Challenges

Concept: The challenge begins with a found website that forms the foundation for a design and coding process. Once a website is selected, the following workflow begins:

- get a full screenshot of the webpage for reproduction
- reproduce the webpage(s) as wireframes to model the HTML5 semantic layout
- reproduce the webpage(s) as high-fidelity designs to model the styling and interactions
- build the webpage(s) using HTML and CSS
