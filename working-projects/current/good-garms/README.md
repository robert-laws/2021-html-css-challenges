# UX/HTML/CSS Challenge # 5 - E-Commerce Website

## The Challenge

The fifth challenge in the UX/HTML/CSS Design and Code Challenge series is an e-commerce website. This challenge aims to combine several techniques that were applied in previous challenges including CSS Grid, Flexbox, atomic design, and responsive design. Expanding on these features, this challenge aims to add implementation of accessibility standards and incorporating dynamic data loading and interactivity with javascript The inspiration for this challenge comes from the website [Good Garms](https://www.goodgarms.com/), an online shop to purchase clothing that prioritizes sustainability.

The challenge, similar to ([previous challenges](https://www.robert-developer.com/challenges/)), is to recreate a design based on another website that serves as inspiration. The additional challenge this time is to also replicate the functionality of the website - in particular the dynamic population, filtering, and ability to view details of product and article content. The challenge also places focus on meeting accessibility standards as outlined in the [WAI-ARIA Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).

## Designing with Components in Mind

The approach taken in this challenge is to analyze the website design and look for instances where elements are used within an atomic design pattern. This includes identifying elements in the design that are used as atoms as well as more complex combination of elements that can be identified as molecules and organisms. Analyzing the design in this way will help identify where there are foundational elements and combinations that can be used to build more complex parts of the website.
