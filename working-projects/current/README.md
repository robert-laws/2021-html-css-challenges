# UX/HTML/CSS Challenge # 3 - E-Commerce Website

## The Challenge

The third challenge in the UX/HTML/CSS Design and Code Challenge series is an e-commerce website. The rationale for this particular challenge was to find a site that could easily lend itself to use of CSS Grid layout. The inspiration for this challenge comes from the website [Bohemian Traders](https://bohemiantraders.com/), which is an online shop to purchase clothing based in Australia.

The challenge, like [previous](https://robert-laws.com/blog/challenge-one) [challenges](https://robert-laws.com/blog/challenge-two), is to recreate the design of the website homepage ([live version of the final website](https://www.robert-developer.com/challenges/three/)). The focus of this challenge is slightly different than previous challenges in that the focus for this challenge is less on design process and more on application of CSS Grid for mobile and desktop.

## Putting CSS Grid to Work

[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout) is specification for layout in CSS that makes two dimensional grid systems. CSS Grid has an extensive set of features to create columns, rows, designate parts of the grid for specific purposes, and control alignment in all directions. Because it has an extensive set of features, CSS Grid takes some practice to get comfortable with the features. Thankfully, there are many great resources available to help learn CSS Grid including many paid and free tutorials, several books, and many good websites. Here's a sample of some of the websites I consulted when learning the fundamentals.
