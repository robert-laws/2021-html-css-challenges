# UX/HTML/CSS Challenge # 1 - Blog Website

## The Challenge

The first challenge is a blogging website. The inspiration for this challenge comes from the website [We The Parents](https://wetheparents.org), which is a blog intended for parents.

The challenge is to recreate the design of the website homepage. The process begins by breaking down the design with the tool Adobe XD. After that, it's on to VSCode to begin putting together the HTML layout before finally adding the CSS styling.

## The Website Structure

The homepage of the website has many common features found on a blogging website including:

- header with navigational links
- list of several blog entries with teaser content
- sidebar with some basic narrative information
- footer with copyright and additional navigation.

The main challenge of the website is deciding how to divide up the website into semantic sections such as the header, footer, main and aside content areas. Within larger semantic sections like the header, the structure can be further subdivided into smaller groupings, such as textual and social icons navigational groups. The design used an atomic design approach to identify building blocks or atoms that could be combined to make grouped units or molecules and further combined to make up organisms, as shown below for the elements composing the sidebar section of the website.

## Design

The design of the site includes 8 colors, focused on two dominant colors, a lime green and yellow with some tints of the same. The typography is mostly sans serif typefaces with a mix of normal and uppercase. A serif typeface is used for the description and aside text. The only exception is the logo, which is a brush script handwriting typeface.

The design makes use of a few repeated components, most notably the blog post teasers. The search box, social media icons, and some navigational elements are also repeated.
