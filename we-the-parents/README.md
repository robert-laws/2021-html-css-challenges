# UX/HTML/CSS Challenge - Blog Website

## The Challenge

The challenge for today is to design and develop a blogging website. The inspiration for this challenge comes from the website [We The Parents](https://wetheparents.org), which is a blogging website for parents.

The homepage of this website has many common features found on blogging websites including a header with navigation, a list of several blog entries with teaser content, and a footer. There's also a sidebar with some basic narrative information about the website and it's purpose.

## The Website Structure

The structure of the website is divided into just a few major groupings. There's a header which contains a top navbar and the main website navigation. The middle section of the website contains the main content - the blog post teasers - and the sidebar content. Finally, there's a footer section.

## Design

The design of the site includes 8 colors, focused on two dominant colors, a lime green and yellow with some tints of the same. The typography is mostly sans serif typefaces with a mix of normal and uppercase. A serif typeface is used for the description and aside text. The only exception is the logo, which is a brush script handwriting typeface.

The design makes use of a few repeated components, most notably the blog post teasers. The search box, social media icons, and some navigational elements are also repeated.
